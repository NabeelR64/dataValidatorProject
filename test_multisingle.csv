Dr. Samulski is a pioneer in the field of gene therapy. Over thirty (30) years ago, Dr. Samulski was the first person to realize the potential to use the adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vehicle to replace a defective gene with a healthy gene. Since that time, he has re-engineered the naturally occurring virus to target delivery to certain tissues, de-target other tissues, and improve its safety. This has resulted in over twenty (20) patents related to the use of AAV for therapeutic uses. Dr. Samulski continues to lead innovation in the field of vector optimization and AAV re-engineering.","Bamboo Therapeutics is a spin-out of Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, per an article in BioCentury: http://bambootherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bamboo-Harnessing-AAV-Tropisms-2016-07-18-BioCentury-article-published.pdf (Cindy, 8/1/2016) incorporated DE, then also NC Per Cindy: I had to create ICS example/projection metrics during its strategic planning some years ago.
