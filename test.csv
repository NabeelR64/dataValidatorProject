Deltasphere is now doing business as 3rdTech and is operated by the same person as the other two companies but again, not affiliated. They once sold a product called Deltasphere but they rebranded their products along with the company name. These were all software (copyright) licenses originating in 2000/2001 so the original software is now mostly obsolete. UNC had no rights to the trade names, patents that may exist, or any mechanical devices. We do still have a license with 3rdTech.
